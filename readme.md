=== About

Abstract Graphics Library (AGL) is a lighweight and cross-platform library for packetized rendering, written in ANSI C.
AGL provides a simple C API that abstracts platform specific context creation and rendering APIs (OpenGL and DirectX).

Currently only Windows and OpenGL are supported, however Linux and Mac OSX are planned as well as iOS and Android.

=== Building

Please see building.md for instructions on how to build AGL from source.
